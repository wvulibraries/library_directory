## Did you find a Bug? 

### WVU, WVU LIbraries, and Affiliates?

* If you are part of WVU or WVU Libraries please use the help desk ticket system to appropriately report your error.
* Please report with the following details:
  - Bug Description
  - Steps to Reproduce
  - Expected Behavior
  - Screenshots
  - System Information (Browser, Operating System, Device, Version Numbers)
  - Additional Context if Applicabale

### Github Contributors

* If the bug is a security vulnerability, please report them confidentially to any members of the [WVULibraries Organization](https://github.com/orgs/wvulibraries/people).  
* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/wvulibraries/library_directory/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/wvulibraries/library_directory/issues/new?template=bug_report.md).

## Did you fix an issue, or add an enhancment? 

* Ensure that all code modified and all code written is properly tested.  
* Ensure that to the best of your ability the build passes (_CI can sometimes be fickle so if the tests all pass locally and the build is not working because of a randomized failed test it is okay to move on_).  
* Ensure that rubo cop mostly passes and your not introducing new code smells.  
* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch/feature.
* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

## Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?

Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial to the stability, functionality, or testability and will most likely be ignored.  Instead try to focus on code that extends readability, or helps to alleviate code smells.  

## Do you want to contribute to documentation? 

If so please add to the wiki, or send informatin in markdown format to one of the contributing members of the WVU Libraries.
